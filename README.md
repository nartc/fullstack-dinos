A demo library that shows how to build an application using [Nx](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro), [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/), [Angular](https://angular.dev/), [Apollo Angular](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/apollo-angular/docs), [@ngrx/component-store](https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store) and [@ngrx/signals]().

The application is a simple backend server running on NestJS using Prisma. The frontend is built using Angular 17, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/components/). It is a simple CRUD application showing how to use Apollo with the different component level state management from NgRx.
